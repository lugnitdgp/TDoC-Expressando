# **Expressando**

## About the project:

Expressando is a real-time sign language detection system made using OpenCV, Keras, Tensorflow and SciPy. It is a beginner-friendly project, suitable for the enthusiasts in the field of Machine-Learning and Deep-Learning. The projects primarily aim to highlight the basic use of OpenCV in image processing manipulation, training of models with Keras using Tensorflow as backend, and finally, the detection of our customised sign-language after constructing a Convolutional Neural Network on it. 

## Tech stacks used:

OpenCV, NumPy, TensorFlow, Keras, SciPy

# Aim:

To predict the sign language detection system based on customised dataset with atmost accuracy.
